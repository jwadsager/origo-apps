Apps for the Origo Cloud System.

The Origo Cloud System (OCS) is a platform for building private infrastructure clouds.
OCS aims to make it very easy to manage VM's, storage and networking from a web UI, through an API and from a command line client.
OCS consists of a hardware platform, **Origo Engine**, and a software stack, **Steamengine**.

The public cloud computing offering from Origo Systems (available at http://origo.io) is built with OCS, i.e. the
Steamengine software stack running on Origo Engines (http://origo.io/info/products/engine).

One of the unique things about OCS is the ability to run pre-packaged "apps", i.e. a set of imaster mages and
instructions which set up a system of servers which typically offer a specific service like e.g. a mail service
or a file service.

The source code and scripts for building the apps we distribute with OCS are available here.
