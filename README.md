# origo-apps
Apps for the Origo infrastructure platform.

The Origo infrastruture platform (OIP) is a platform for managing VM's, storage and networking.
OIP runs the cloud computing offering from Origo Systems (available at https://www.origo.io), and also runs the
boxes we sell to install a private compute cloud in your own server room.

One of the unique things about OIP is the ability to run pre-packaged "apps", i.e. a set of imaster mages and
instructions which set up a system of servers which typically offer a specific service like e.g. a mail service
or a file service.

The source code and scripts for building the apps we distribute with OIP are available here.
